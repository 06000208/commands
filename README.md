# commands

Commands are instructions to perform specific tasks, and the concept is fairly widespread in computing, such as in command-line interfaces.

This package provides extendable classes for structuring functions as commands with metadata, intended for specific contexts.

This is mainly useful for programming "chat commands" such as in IRC, Discord, etc. in a dynamic way.
